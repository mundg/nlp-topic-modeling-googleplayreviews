6356,Good games can improve baby skills but bad games increase their stress levels. This game expects shapes to be placed very precisely which kids can't do as they are still developing. No clear instructions and learning mechanism for example there is a blue patch on left that means blue balloon must be poped but even if baby pop other balloons there is no difference. The sound the feedback makes baby understand wether he is winning or losing and based on that they learn.
